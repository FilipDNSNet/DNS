Priviously we had a database for each project. now all of them come to on database: "dns_net_geodb"
apart from priviousstrategy for each new database that we have edit and view groups, we define
a new strategy for databases such as "dns_net_geodb".
This database has different types of tables, and man cannot define an uniform user-definition-schema.
each table might have different access level for people in a same department. 
Therefore, some functions are defined:
	access.dns_set_privileges_read(db text, sch text, tbl text, usr text)
	access.dns_set_privileges_edit(db text, sch text, tbl text, usr text)
	access.dns_revoke_privileges_on_table(db text, sch text, tbl text, usr text)
	
in each case we can easily grant or revoke privileges to users.
in adition, we define a read only user_group : "gr_dns_net_geodb_readonly"
, because most of the intern users, should be able to see the most tables.
the difference with "gr_dns_net_geodb_viewer" is that the later can see all the tables.
while "gr_dns_net_geodb_readonly" can see customized selection of tables.
